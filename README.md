 The task, above illustrates how the backgroung color of the page changes after clicking on the button.
The background color changes due to the effect of javascript and the variouss styles applied to it. From my understanding;
Random Function indicates that the color changes without any specific order and also the area
where that effect should be displayed.
The function color now calls the color via '#' and its other elements.
